# Decision Tree
Ensemble technique:
- Bagging
  - Linear Regression 
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- Boosting 
  - Gradient boosted tree
  - Adoptive boosting
  - XG Boosting
- Stocking
### Ensemble Technique: 
Where we involve multiple decision maker. Here decision makers are machine learning algorithums.
### Bagging:
Where multiple number of decision makers are invloved but all are of same type. There recomondation or output is averaged to arrive on to a conclusion.
